# Mirage-Distortion
An Almost Identity 

![](/Media/screen-record.gif)

## Introduction
I have no idea what I want to do or who I want to be in the future and trying to talk or write about it only frustrates me even more since I end up talking in circles or contradicting myself, so I will not be discussing that any further to save me from embarrassment.

## Some Inspriation Imagery
Here are some masks I as looking at a few weeks before I actually started coding and also before the world started falling apart. I particularly liked the Japanese Noh masks because of their exaggerated features that emphasizes the wearer's identity and past. I was going to try something similar, as seen in the drawings in the next section, but with the whole global pandemic thing going on I started thinking about my future and getting very anxious about it, so this project turned into something that reflected that more.

## Initial Drawings
Here are two initial drawings I did. The one on the left is the first one I did. It's most similar to the Noh masks I picked out and is supposed to represent how I feel like rot and mold. The second one is a mask of bugs crawling all over my face, as a representation of my anxiety. The current project is most similar to the latter (see the Bugs class and letsMakeBugs function in the code) but I changed the bugs to the image distortion it is now.
